This mod contains an API for other mods to use.

Current options:

-- Prevent specific type+subtype blocks from having custom detailed info
  Useful for avoiding this mod to add irrelvant info to your repurposed blocks.

  To use, call in BeforeStart():

    MyAPIGateway.Utilities.SendModMessage(514062285, new MyTuple<string, string, MyDefinitionId>("your mod name", "NoDetailInfo", new MyDefinitionId(typeof(MyObjectBuilder_UpgradeModule), "YourSubtypeId")));


-- Prevent specific type+subtype items from getting crafting info appended to their tooltips.
  Useful if you already include such data yourself.

  To use, call in BeforeStart():

    MyAPIGateway.Utilities.SendModMessage(514062285, new MyTuple<string, string, MyDefinitionId>("your mod name", "NoItemTooltip", new MyDefinitionId(typeof(MyObjectBuilder_Ore), "YourSubtypeId")));


-- Prevent specific type+subtype blocks from getting their description appended to with mod and other stuff.
  Useful if you already include such data yourself.

  To use, call in BeforeStart():

    MyAPIGateway.Utilities.SendModMessage(514062285, new MyTuple<string, string, MyDefinitionId>("your mod name", "NoDescriptionInfo", new MyDefinitionId(typeof(MyObjectBuilder_Refinery), "YourSubtypeId")));


-- All of the above.

    MyAPIGateway.Utilities.SendModMessage(514062285, new MyTuple<string, string, MyDefinitionId>("your mod name", "All", new MyDefinitionId(typeof(MyObjectBuilder_Refinery), "YourSubtypeId")));



For all of the above:
  Method must be called for everyone (it's not MP synchronized).
  Must be within the first 10 simulation ticks.

  The method's parameters explained:
  - The 514062285 number is the mod's API ID, leave it be.
  - "your mod name" is for log/error information, you could feed ModContext.ModName there if you're calling it from a session component.
  - 2nd string defines what the requested thing is, only the ones I specified are supported (case insensitive btw).
  - and finally the MyDefinitionId is the ID my mod will ignore for that request.

  If 'Internal Info' is enabled during loading, the mod's log will list the API-received items/blocks.
