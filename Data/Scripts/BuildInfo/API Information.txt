This mod contains an API for other mods to use.

Current API:

1. Prevent specific type+subtype blocks from having custom detailed info
  Useful for avoiding this mod to add irrelvant info to your repurposed blocks.

  To use, call in BeforeStart():

    MyAPIGateway.Utilities.SendModMessage(514062285, new MyTuple<string, string, MyDefinitionId>("your mod name", "NoDetailInfo", new MyDefinitionId(typeof(MyObjectBuilder_UpgradeModule), "YourSubtypeId")));


2. Prevent specific type+subtype items from getting crafting info appended to their tooltips.
  Useful if you already include such data yourself.

  To use, call in BeforeStart():

    MyAPIGateway.Utilities.SendModMessage(514062285, new MyTuple<string, string, MyDefinitionId>("your mod name", "NoItemTooltip", new MyDefinitionId(typeof(MyObjectBuilder_Ore), "YourSubtypeId")));

  Must be within the first 25 ticks because tooltip strings are generated once.



For both of these:
  Method must be called for everyone (it's not MP synchronized).

  The method's parameters explained:
  - The 514062285 number is the mod's API ID, leave it be.
  - "your mod name" is for error information, you could feed ModContext.ModName there if you're calling it from a session component.
  - 2nd string defines what the requested thing is, only the ones I specified are supported (case insensitive btw).
  - and finally the MyDefinitionId is the ID my mod will ignore for that request.

  If 'Internal Info' is enabled during loading, the mod's log will list the API-received items/blocks.
