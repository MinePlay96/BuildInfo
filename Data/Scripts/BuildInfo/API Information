This mod contains an API for other mods to use.

Currently the only API feature is to disable this mod's detail info for certain block type+subtype.

To use it, call:

    MyAPIGateway.Utilities.SendModMessage(514062285, new MyDefinitionId(typeof(MyObjectBuilder_UpgradeModule), "YourSubtypeId"));


The upgrade module being an example type, you can send any block type you want and you can send as many as you want.

The method must be called on clients and server, and must be done after this mod's LoadData().
Alternatively use MyAPIGateway.Utilities.InvokeOnGameThread() to execute it next tick.
